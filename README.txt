A simple application that collects and sends traffic generated by apache to graphite.

Place the following three lines of configuration in your apache config:

LogFormat "%h %v %I %O %^FB %t \"%r\" %>s" traffic
LogIOTrackTTFB ON
CustomLog "|/usr/local/sbin/apachetraffic" traffic

Compile and put the application in /usr/sbin/apachetraffic, and copy
the apachetraffic.toml to /etc/apachetraffic/. Adjust graphite address and
prefix to fit your needs, restart apache and you're all set.

You can use grafana or some other graphing software to visualize the
data you collected.
